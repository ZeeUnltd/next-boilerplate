        <p>Revamped Onboarding Platform for United Bank For Africa</p>
        <p>
          To develop a fresh user experience for our potential users; I was to
          to work with one of our UI/UX designers to create a new User
          experience for our prospective users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there are several products with different onboarding processes,
          the requirement was to create just one platform that houses all the
          onboarding processes together in one.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several iterations on design, I developed all the components
          without overloading the application with several libraries, leveraging
          i18n as we support multiple languages, and used Vue Js for
          interactivity and Vuex for state management.
        </p>
        <p>
          I deployed to the testing/staging server and completed the application
          on time after several iterations of adoption. The corporate team
          department adopted the change instantly and deployed the application
          before the other departments were ready.
        </p>

        <p>
          The major challenge confronted here was the selection of distinctive
          divisions as the backend assets at the time were not REST APIs, so it
          was reliant on each division to supply the necessary resources for the
          plug-in. I am happy the platform is still running and usable for the
          following million clients since I cleared out the organization.
